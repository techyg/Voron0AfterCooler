Dual 5015 Fan Mount for Voron 0.1

Design by Greg Huber, Greg's Maker Corner 


Purpose: Provide additional cooling, which will be helpful for many reasons including:

    - PLA, TPU, 
    
    - Faster printing in general 

Goal: Printable on Voron 0.1, easily add after building (no square nuts required)
Supplies needed: 
    - 2 small m5 heat inserts (same kind as used during Voron assembly)
    
    - 2 M3x12mm socket head screws
    
    - 2 5015 fans. I used these: https://amzn.to/2ZfxumB
    
    - Not recommended to wire to SKR e3 v2 fan connection, due to small MOSFETS which may burn out
    
    - Option 1: Klipper Extender if you want to control fans (this will be my approach eventually)
    
    - Option 2: Wire directly to PSU and put a small switch inline to turn on manually at 100%  (my current approach)
    
    - Route wires through bottom 1515 extrusion.
